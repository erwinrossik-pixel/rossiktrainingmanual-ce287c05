    subtitle: "Understanding CMR liability, cargo insurance, and risk protection in freight forwarding.",
    
    // Introduction
    intro: "Insurance is the safety net of freight forwarding. When goods are damaged, stolen, or lost, the question of who pays - and how much - depends entirely on the insurance structure. Many freight forwarders and clients don't understand the critical gap between CMR liability and full cargo insurance. This knowledge can save your company from catastrophic losses and position you as a trusted advisor to clients.",
    
    // Section 1: Types of Insurance
    typesOfTransportInsurance: "Types of Transport Insurance",
    insuranceTypesIntro: "The transport insurance landscape has three main pillars: carrier liability insurance (mandatory), freight forwarder liability insurance (essential), and cargo/goods insurance (optional but often critical). Each serves a different purpose and provides different protection levels.",

    carrierLegalLiability: "Carrier's legal liability under CMR Convention",
    cmrLiabilityDetail1: "CMR liability insurance covers the carrier's legal responsibility for goods during international road transport. It is NOT full value insurance. The CMR Convention limits carrier liability to 8.33 SDR (Special Drawing Rights) per kilogram of gross weight - approximately €10/kg.",
    cmrLiabilityDetail2: "Important limitations: The carrier is only liable for loss, damage, or delay caused during their custody. They are NOT liable for: inherent vice of goods, shipper's fault, force majeure (war, natural disasters), or packaging defects the carrier couldn't detect.",

    cargoInsuranceDetail1: "Cargo insurance (also called goods-in-transit insurance) covers the actual value of goods regardless of who is at fault. It can be purchased by the shipper, consignee, or freight forwarder on their behalf. Coverage is typically 'all risks' or 'named perils'.",
    cargoInsuranceDetail2: "All-risks policies cover everything except specifically excluded perils (usually war, nuclear, inherent vice). Named perils policies only cover listed events (fire, collision, theft). Premium rates range from 0.05% to 0.5% of cargo value depending on goods type and route.",

    // Section 4: Freight Forwarder Liability
    ffLiabilityTitle: "Freight Forwarder Liability Insurance",
    ffLiabilityContent: "As a freight forwarder, you have your own liability separate from carriers. FF liability insurance protects against claims arising from your professional activities: booking errors, documentation mistakes, incorrect instructions to carriers, failure to arrange proper insurance when instructed.",
    ffLiabilityDetail1: "Standard FF liability limits range from €500,000 to €5,000,000 per occurrence. Consider higher limits if handling high-value goods or large contract clients. Some clients require proof of FF liability insurance before awarding contracts.",
    ffLiabilityDetail2: "What's typically covered: Professional negligence, errors and omissions, breach of warranty of authority, customs fines (some policies), legal defense costs. What's NOT covered: Intentional misconduct, unlicensed activities, carrier's liability (separate policy).",

    // Introduction
    intro: "Asigurarea este plasa de siguranță a freight forwarding-ului. Când mărfurile sunt deteriorate, furate sau pierdute, întrebarea cine plătește - și cât - depinde în întregime de structura asigurării. Mulți freight forwarderi și clienți nu înțeleg decalajul critic dintre răspunderea CMR și asigurarea completă de marfă. Această cunoaștere poate salva compania ta de pierderi catastrofale și te poate poziționa ca un consilier de încredere pentru clienți.",
    
    // Section 1: Types of Insurance
    typesOfTransportInsurance: "Tipuri de Asigurare de Transport",
    insuranceTypesIntro: "Peisajul asigurărilor de transport are trei piloni principali: asigurarea de răspundere a transportatorului (obligatorie), asigurarea de răspundere a freight forwarderului (esențială) și asigurarea de marfă (opțională dar adesea critică). Fiecare servește un scop diferit și oferă niveluri diferite de protecție.",
